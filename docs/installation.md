# Installation

If you get a chance to scroll down this page, you might be thinking to yourself:

> Why is installing Native Navigation so complicated?

Good question. There are a couple of factors...

1. Native Navigation changes the way you structure your React Native app by encouraging multiple 
React "Root Views" rather than one. This means if you're using the standard boilerplate that came 
with the React Native CLI starter template, we have to change some of the code to make it work.
2. The iOS implementation of Native Navigation is written in Swift, and using Swift in React Native 
apps has some challenges due to Swift code needing to be dynamically linked. React Native projects 
are typically all done with static linking. We are working on making this aspect of the setup less
complicated, but it might take some time. The easiest way to skirt around these issues is to use
CocoaPods to manage your dependencies. It's worth pointing out that this will mean you can't use 
`react-native link` for other dependencies you install.

If you are starting a new project from scratch, we recommend downloading or cloning our 
[boilerplate starter project](https://github.com/lelandrichardson/native-navigation-boilerplate).



## Creating a new project with Native Navigation

You can start your project using React Native's CLI. If you do not have the CLI installed yet,
run the following command:

```bash
npm i -g react-native-cli
```

With the CLI installed, you can create a new project. In this example we will call it `MyNewProject`:

```bash
react-native init MyNewProject
cd MyNewProject
```

Install the latest version of native-navigation:

```bash
npm i --save native-navigation
```

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT use `react-native link` to link native navigation. It is currently not supported.
 


## JavaScript Project Setup

We recommend structuring your project in a slightly different way than the React Native template starts
you off with. For a more detailed guide, please check out our [Project Structure Guide](/docs/guides/project-structure.md).

For a quicker setup, we are going to just change the minimal amount in this guide.

You should start with two entry files, `index.ios.js` and `index.android.js`.

In both files, you should have a demo app component set up, with a call to `AppRegistry.registerComponent`
that looks something like this:

```js
AppRegistry.registerComponent('MyNewProject', () => MyNewProject);
```

We want to change this to import Native Navigation and use `NativeNavigator.registerScreen` instead in both files:

```js
// top of the file
import Navigator from 'native-navigation';

// bottom of the file 
Navigator.registerScreen('Home', () => MyNewProject);
```

And you're done!  We have now made this component a "Screen", and we have called it "Home".


Note: It is also completely fine to just delete one of these files, and rename it to be `index.js`, and
have the entry point of your application be cross-platform. This is entirely up to you, though.



## iOS Project Setup

Native Navigation is written in Swift, and thus it is currently required to be imported into
your iOS App as a dynamic framework. We are actively working on an approach to importing this project
such that it can be statically linked, but for now the easiest way to use Native Navigation is with CocoaPods.

It is important to understand that if you use CocoaPods for Native Navigation, all of the other 
native libraries that depend on React, as well as React itself, need to also be imported using CocoaPods.

To get started with CocoaPods, we first want to make sure we have it installed:

```bash
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

React Native requires CocoaPods version 1.2.0 or greater, so verify that you have at least that version:

```bash
pod --version
```

If you do, we now need to create a `Podfile` for your ios project.

```bash
cd ios
pod init
```

There should now be a `Podfile` in this directory. Open it. You should edit your Podfile to look like this:

```ruby
target 'MyNewProject' do
  # Native Navigation uses Swift, so this line is required!
  use_frameworks!

  # Native Navigation!
  pod 'native-navigation', :path => '../node_modules/native-navigation'

  # To use CocoaPods with React Native, you need to add this specific Yoga spec as well
  pod 'Yoga', :path => '../node_modules/react-native/ReactCommon/yoga/Yoga.podspec'

  # You don't necessarily need all of these subspecs, but this would be a typical setup.
  pod 'React', :path => '../node_modules/react-native', :subspecs => [
    'Core',
    'RCTText',
    'RCTNetwork',
    'RCTWebSocket', # needed for debugging
    'RCTAnimation',
    'RCTImage',
    'RCTNetwork'
    # Add any other subspecs you want to use in your project
  ]
  
  # Add any other dependencies here, including any 3rd party native libraries that you depend on for
  # React Native.
end
```

Now that your `Podfile` is ready, you can run `pod install`:

```bash
pod install
```

There should now be an `MyNewProject.xcworkspace` available in your ios directory, which was created
by CocoaPods. You should use this file to open your app up in XCode, NOT the .xcodeproj file.

We now need to make some modifications to our project in Xcode. Open up the project:

```bash
open MyNewProject.xcworkspace
```

![Convert swift syntax](/assets/install_swift_syntax.png)

Xcode may presents a window asking if you want to update the project to the latest swift version, click "Convert". There aren't
any actual changes that need to be made. React Native's template just has the project set to use Swift 2.3 
instead of Swift 3.


React Native's starter template will have the React Project initially statically linked to your project,
but now we are using CocoaPods, so we want to get rid of them.

In Xcode, go to the "Project navigator" in the left sidebar and find the `Libraries` folder. Select
every library in that folder, then right-click it and hit "Delete":

![Select all of the libraries](/assets/install_remove_libs_1.png)

For the dialog that appears, click "Remove References":

![Hit "Remove References"](/assets/install_remove_libs_2.png)


Now we need to set up our navigation in our project's actual code. We are going to do most of the
work in the `AppDelegate` class that React Native's starter template provides you.

The starter template has a single `RCTRootView` being created with a bundle URL, which then internally creates
an `RCTBridge` instance. Native Navigation needs a single `RCTBridge` instance to handle the creation
of `RCTRootView`s itself. To do this, we recommend implementing a shared "singleton" object in your app
that implements both the `RCTBridgeDelegate` and `ReactNavigationCoordinatorDelegate` protocols. In the starter 
template, the main `AppDelegate`  object is a good candidate.

Start by modifying your `AppDelegate.h` header file to make your `AppDelegate` class implement the
`RCTBridgeDelegate` and `ReactNavigationCoordinatorDelegate` protocols:

```objective-c
@interface AppDelegate : UIResponder <UIApplicationDelegate, RCTBridgeDelegate, ReactNavigationCoordinatorDelegate>
```

You will also need to include the following headers:

```objective-c
#import <React/RCTBridge.h>
@import NativeNavigation;
```

In the `AppDelegate.m` implementation file, we need to implement those delegate methods and set up
Native Navigation's `ReactNavigationCoordinator`.

The `RCTBridgeDelegate` has a `sourceURLForBridge:` method, which is expected to return an `NSURL` for
the app's JavaScript entry point.  For this, we recommend using the `RCTBundleURLProvider`, and you can
actually just copy the code that the starter template uses in `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:`.

```objective-c
- (NSURL *)sourceURLForBridge:(RCTBridge *)bridge {
  return [[RCTBundleURLProvider sharedSettings] jsBundleURLForBundleRoot:@"index.ios" fallbackResource:nil];
}
```

The `ReactNavigationCoordinatorDelegate` has a `rootViewControllerForCoordinator:` delegate method that
is meant to return the root view controller of the entire app that NativeNavigation will use to understand
the current navigation stack.  Typically, this is just the `rootViewController` of the window:

```objective-c
- (UIViewController *)rootViewControllerForCoordinator: (ReactNavigationCoordinator *)coordinator {
  return self.window.rootViewController;
}
```

Now we want to adjust the `AppDelegate`'s `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` method.

The first thing we want to do is create an `RCTBridge` instance with the delegate:

```objective-c
RCTBridge *bridge = [[RCTBridge alloc] initWithDelegate:self
                                          launchOptions:launchOptions];
```

Native Navigation has a shared `ReactNavigationCoordinator` instance that does a lot of the coordination
of the library. It needs an `RCTBridge` and an `ReactNavigationCoordinatorDelegate`:

```objective-c
ReactNavigationCoordinator *coordinator = [ReactNavigationCoordinator sharedInstance];

[coordinator setBridge:bridge];
[coordinator setDelegate:self];
```

Now the last thing you need to do is create the App's root ViewController.  If your app launches
with a React Native screen, you would want to do this:

```objective-c
ReactViewController *mainViewController = [[ReactViewController alloc] initWithModuleName:@"Home"];
self.window.rootViewController = [[coordinator navigation] makeNavigationControllerWithRootViewController:mainViewController];
```

In this example we have used the string `@"Home"` as the registered screen name, which we will later have
to set up in our JavaScript code.

At this point your `AppDelegate.h` file should look like:

```objective-c
#import <UIKit/UIKit.h>
#import <React/RCTBridge.h>
@import NativeNavigation;

@interface AppDelegate : UIResponder <UIApplicationDelegate, RCTBridgeDelegate, ReactNavigationCoordinatorDelegate>

@property (nonatomic, strong) UIWindow *window;

@end
```

And your `AppDelegate.m` file like this:

```objective-c
#import "AppDelegate.h"

#import <React/RCTBundleURLProvider.h>
@import NativeNavigation;

@implementation AppDelegate

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{
  RCTBridge *bridge = [[RCTBridge alloc] initWithDelegate:self
                                      launchOptions:launchOptions];
  ReactNavigationCoordinator *coordinator = [ReactNavigationCoordinator sharedInstance];

  [coordinator setBridge:bridge];
  [coordinator setDelegate:self];

  self.window = [[UIWindow alloc] initWithFrame:[UIScreen mainScreen].bounds];
  ReactViewController *mainViewController = [[ReactViewController alloc] initWithModuleName:@"Home"];
  self.window.rootViewController = [[coordinator navigation] makeNavigationControllerWithRootViewController:mainViewController];
  [self.window makeKeyAndVisible];
  return YES;
}

- (NSURL *)sourceURLForBridge:(RCTBridge *)bridge {
  return [[RCTBundleURLProvider sharedSettings] jsBundleURLForBundleRoot:@"index.ios" fallbackResource:nil];
}

- (UIViewController *)rootViewControllerForCoordinator: (ReactNavigationCoordinator *)coordinator {
  return self.window.rootViewController;
}

@end
```

We are done modifying our main project! One more thing, though. If you have used the React Native
starter template to get to this point, you should have a `MyNewProjectTests.m` file for running
tests.  The default test implementation that the template uses the `RCTSetLogFunction` global function,
which is written using Objective-C++ and cannot be referenced in the tests project since React is now
being imported as a dynamic framework. We are working on fixing this issue. In the meantime, you can
just write tests without using the `RCTSetLogFunction` function.

You can change your `testRendersWelcomeScreen` method to look like:

```objective-c
- (void)testRendersWelcomeScreen
{
  UIViewController *vc = [[[[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate] window] rootViewController];
  NSDate *date = [NSDate dateWithTimeIntervalSinceNow:TIMEOUT_SECONDS];
  BOOL foundElement = NO;

  while ([date timeIntervalSinceNow] > 0 && !foundElement) {
    [[NSRunLoop mainRunLoop] runMode:NSDefaultRunLoopMode beforeDate:[NSDate dateWithTimeIntervalSinceNow:0.1]];
    [[NSRunLoop mainRunLoop] runMode:NSRunLoopCommonModes beforeDate:[NSDate dateWithTimeIntervalSinceNow:0.1]];

    foundElement = [self findSubviewInView:vc.view matching:^BOOL(UIView *view) {
      if ([view.accessibilityLabel isEqualToString:TEXT_TO_LOOK_FOR]) {
        return YES;
      }
      return NO;
    }];
  }

  XCTAssertTrue(foundElement, @"Couldn't find element with text '%@' in %d seconds", TEXT_TO_LOOK_FOR, TIMEOUT_SECONDS);
}
```

At this point, you should be able to build and run your iOS project!




## Android Project Setup


In `android/settings.gradle`, you need to include Native Navigation as a project to build it from source:

```
include ':native-navigation'
project(':native-navigation').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/native-navigation/lib/android')
```

Then, in `android/app/build.gradle`, you can add the following to the `dependencies` block:

```
dependencies {
    // ... any dependencies you already had
    
    // if you don't already depend on the support libraries, add these
    compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:25.1.1'
    compile 'com.android.support:support-annotations:25.1.1'
    
    // add native-navigation
    compile project(':native-navigation')
}
```

Add the following to the `android` block:

```
    packagingOptions {
        exclude 'META-INF/LICENSE'
        exclude 'META-INF/DEPENDENCIES.txt'
        exclude 'META-INF/LICENSE.txt'
        exclude 'META-INF/NOTICE.txt'
        exclude 'META-INF/NOTICE'
        exclude 'META-INF/DEPENDENCIES'
        exclude 'META-INF/notice.txt'
        exclude 'META-INF/license.txt'
        exclude 'META-INF/dependencies.txt'
        exclude 'META-INF/LGPL2.1'
    }
```

Finally, change the `compoileSdkVersion` and `targetSdkVersion` to `25`.

That is all that is needed for gradle settings, but now we need to set up the app.

In `MainApplication.java`, we need to add `NativeNavigationPackage` to the list of packages:

```java
import com.airbnb.android.react.navigation.NativeNavigationPackage;

// ...

@Override
protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {
  return Arrays.<ReactPackage>asList(
      new MainReactPackage(),
      new NativeNavigationPackage()
  );
}
```

Then, in the application's `onCreate()` method, we need to provide the `ReactNavigationCoordinator` 
the `ReactInstanceManager`:

```java
import com.airbnb.android.react.navigation.ReactNavigationCoordinator;

// ...

@Override
public void onCreate() {
  super.onCreate();
  SoLoader.init(this, /* native exopackage */ false);
  
  // These three lines need to be added
  ReactNavigationCoordinator coordinator = ReactNavigationCoordinator.sharedInstance;
  coordinator.injectReactInstanceManager(mReactNativeHost.getReactInstanceManager());
  coordinator.start(this);
}
```

Now, in `MainActivity.java`, we want to change it to extend NativeNavigation's `ReactActivity` 
instead of React Native's `ReactActivity` class.

You can remove the `getMainComponentName()` overridden method and replace it with a `getInitialScreenName()`
method:

```java
import com.airbnb.android.react.navigation.ReactActivity;

public class MainActivity extends ReactActivity {

    /**
     * Returns the name of the screen registered from JavaScript.
     */
    @Override
    protected String getInitialScreenName() {
        return "Home";
    }
}
```
