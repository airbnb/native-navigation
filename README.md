## DISCLAIMER

**This project is currently in beta**. 

Many of the core APIs are subject to change, and we do not consider this project "Production Ready" 
until it hits a 1.0 release. We encourage people to try this library out and provide us feedback as 
we get it to a stable state we are confident in, but not to rely on it for production use until 
then.

## Related Projects & Alternatives

Native Navigation is a navigation library for the React Native platform. There are many navigation 
libraries in the React Native ecosystem. Native Navigation is unique in that it is built on top of
the iOS and Android platform navigational components, and is this more "native" than most other 
options which implement navigation from scratch in JavaScript on top of base React Native components
like `View` and `Animated`.

[React Native Navigation](https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation) by Wix engineering is an 
alternative library that uses "Native" navigation components of each platform, and has been around 
longer than Native Navigation. If you need a stable / production-ready navigation library *today* 
that uses native platform based navigation components, we recommend you check this library out.

If you are investigating navigation solutions and you are okay with JavaScript-based solutions, we 
also encourage you to check out [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/).
